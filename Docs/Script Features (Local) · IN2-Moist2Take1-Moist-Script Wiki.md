### Moist's Weapon Mod Options

___

-   ### Don’t Lock-on to my Friends
    

> This is Part of : **`Any Vehicle Lock-on Missiles (Players)`** Since My Targeting System Does not really care about who people are and locks on to the nearest player visible on screen or in line of sight, this will stop it Making a target of any friends or players with the script exclusion set on. This will also not target God Mode Players since it would locking to them if they were loading in and not spawned yet.

-   ### Lock-on for any vehicle Exclude Aircraft
    

> Another Part of : **`Any Vehicle Lock-on Missiles (Players)`** This will stop the weapons of an aircraft being taken over by the script Feature, since this disables the vehicle attack input and uses it to execute the features weapon can be annoying if u trying to shoot a player with Lazer cannons, this will disable it for these kinds of vehicle.

-   ### Speed of Missiles:
    

> Like it states sets the actual speed the missiles in `Moist’s Weapon Mods` travel, each feature adds additional speed to the missiles taking consideration of the speed you are traveling so as not to shoot and end up being faster than the missile and colliding with it.

-   ### Bypass Raiju Only & Allow Other Vehicles
    

> Specifically made for the new Raiju Cannons Upgrade feature, enabling this will allow this feature to work for some other select Aircraft. Currently i have added support for B11 Strikeforce, P-996 Lazer and the rouge. As with the Raiju it will increase and improve the default explosive miniguns on these aircraft assuming your current vehicle weapon is cannons and Missile or Bombs.
