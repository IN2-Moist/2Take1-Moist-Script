## Module Descriptions

## Custom Lists for Features

### Ped List

> This is a custom list of peds (NPC's) with a few as a default example. This list you can add your own prefer or favorite character Peds in game so the features that support it can use these to spawn those peds to do the task a feature might do with them.

### Vehicle List

> Like the Ped list this can be used for adding a select set of vehicles you use or like for features enabled for these

## Load PlayerHistory Module

> Player History similar to what the menu has now but with more features.
> 
> > Scid Selection can clicked to copy SCID to clipboard
> > 
> > Auto Stalk their SCID (Auto join them when not in your session until toggle off)
> > 
> > IP Info click to update the feature selection to show all the ip info and copy the IPv4 Address to Clipboard
> > 
> > Add & Remove them from the Blacklist Module (See Below)
> > 
> > Temporary Blacklist Them via SCID IP or Name this works only while they have this toggled on until you restart or reset state

## Load PlayerBar Module

> Adds a Custom Bar Across the very top of the game screen with Players Names that are in session with Information via: Tags & Colours
> 
> > There are 2 versions now, normal game ui rendering version or V2 Playerbar which is scriptdraw and will render on top of any game component pause menu and even loading screens.
> > 
> > Version 2 Playerbar the bar can be colour designed by yourself using the feature options and have it fade from corner to corner with a different colour. I Recommend having some transparency to it (alpha) as like i explained above it draws on top of everything so it can cover parts of social club overlay (Home Key Drop Down) see image below
