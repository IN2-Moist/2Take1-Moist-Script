> This is Part of : **`Any Vehicle Lock-on Missiles (Players)`** Since My Targeting System Does not really care about who people are and locks on to the nearest player visible on screen or in line of sight, this will stop it Making a target of any friends or players with the script exclusion set on. This will also not target God Mode Players since it would locking to them if they were loading in and not spawned yet.

-   ### Lock-on for any vehicle Exclude Aircraft
    

> Another Part of : **`Any Vehicle Lock-on Missiles (Players)`** This will stop the weapons of an aircraft being taken over by the script Feature, since this disables the vehicle attack input and uses it to execute the features weapon can be annoying if u trying to shoot a player with Lazer cannons, this will disable it for these kinds of vehicle.

-   ### Speed of Missiles:
    

> Like it states sets the actual speed the missiles in `Moist’s Weapon Mods` travel, each feature adds additional speed to the missiles taking consideration of the speed you are traveling so as not to shoot and end up being faster than the missile and colliding with it.

-   ### Bypass Raiju Only & Allow Other Vehicles
    

> Specifically made for the new Raiju Cannons Upgrade feature, enabling this will allow this feature to work for some other select Aircraft. Currently i have added support for B11 Strikeforce, P-996 Lazer and the rouge. As with the Raiju it will increase and improve the default explosive miniguns on these aircraft assuming your current vehicle weapon is cannons and Missile or Bombs.

## Moist’s Weapon Mods

___

-   ### Moist’s Orbital Gun
    

> Better than the impact orbital strike in MoistScript 2.x.x.x Shots are more reliable & all Explosions are Orbital Explosions with Actual Orbital Sound and PTFX All Kills using this is like using the orbital cannon itself, players get Obliterated by you!

-   ### Homing Aim
    

> Shoot Additional Homing Missile at target your aiming at

-   ### Better Vehicle Lock-on Missiles v3 **`This Feature disables fire input control for your vehicle`**
    

> Version Successor from the previous versions of this function. This will Replace the current weaponised vehicle lock-on missiles & replace them with Ruiner class missiles which have better tracking. This will also lock-on to the driver rather than Vehicle so if they were to eject/bail from vehicle before missile gets their vehicle they Bail Fail! and get killed! shots should look more legit 800 delay or more.

-   ### Missiles from any vehicle
    

> Shoots a missile in a static forward direction without target lock-on from the front of any vehicle

-   ### Replace F-160 Raiju Cannons:
    

> Selectable Weapon you would like to use in addition to the Raiju Default

-   ### F-160 Raiju Explosive Cannons Upgrade
    

> Designed to make the Raiju Explosive MG Like the Original Lazer Cannons, this feature makes this jet Over Powered and a Number One Griefing Tool! Stealth Attacks are quick and easy with this enabled! Only Works with the Raiju Jet!

> Selectable Bomb Types, this feature only works while your Raiju is in stealth Mode! uses the same fire control as the Jet Cannons

-   ### Any Vehicle Lock-on Missiles (Players)
    

> Custom Missile System Designed by myself for Player lock on Targeting for missiles in any vehicle. For vehicles already equipped with lock-on missiles it will utilise both my targeting and the vehicle targeting to find a target, if no nearby player is targetable it will use the vehicle lock on targeting to give you another target useful for the need to kill NPC’s. This Feature is designed to target players even on foot as long as they are in front of you they get a lock on.

-   ### Vehicle Missiles from my Ass `<delay modifier>`
    

> Shoots additional Lock-on Missiles at locked on target, this version Keeps the last Target and shoots missiles locked onto the target even if the target is not visible on screen (its behind you for instance) this will cause your missiles to shoot at any direction. Your Vehicle is safe using this as you can not damage your vehicle with them.

> Shoots an additional Ruiner Missile at the target locked onto via your homing launcher.

___

## Portable Defence Spheres

___

-   ### Set Below Values Manually
    

> Will Adjust all values below to this one if you just activate the option and value has not changed Input box will popup so you can set this manually

-   ### Anti Player Vehicle
    

> Specifically Targets Player Vehicles, do note that if you make a defence sphere and go too far away from it the vehicle detected will probably get missed due to long distance vehicles not detected far away the actual position of the player detected would be incorrect.

-   ### Anti Player Ped
    

> Improved Since Last Release: Player in any vehicle goes in sphere they get Destroyed WIP needs some tweaking maybe a little over the top Anti Player Ped does same as above only they don’t need to be in any vehicle

-   ### Anti Projectile
    

> Should prevent projectiles and weapons fire in the sphere has been said in game that people were unable to use some weapons like Lazer cannons but this also can be effected by zone flag settings below

-   ### Waypoint Anti Player Ped
    

> Same as The Above "Anti Player Ped", only the location of it can be set manually to anywhere on the map you can place a waypoint!

-   ### Zone Flags for:
    

> **`< Self off | Others off | Self on | Others on>`**
> 
> > turns Defence zone flags on / off depending on option for players

-   ### Remove All Air Defence Zones
    

> This will literally remove any Yacht Defences set seems to also partially work for player yachts cant shoot in the area but does not take you out Updated this to a loop function so defence sphere does not get re-enabled.

## Module Descriptions

## Custom Lists for Features

### Ped List

> This is a custom list of peds (NPC's) with a few as a default example. This list you can add your own prefer or favorite character Peds in game so the features that support it can use these to spawn those peds to do the task a feature might do with them.

### Vehicle List

> Like the Ped list this can be used for adding a select set of vehicles you use or like for features enabled for these

## Load PlayerHistory Module

> Player History similar to what the menu has now but with more features.
> 
> > Scid Selection can clicked to copy SCID to clipboard
> > 
> > Auto Stalk their SCID (Auto join them when not in your session until toggle off)
> > 
> > IP Info click to update the feature selection to show all the ip info and copy the IPv4 Address to Clipboard
> > 
> > Add & Remove them from the Blacklist Module (See Below)
> > 
> > Temporary Blacklist Them via SCID IP or Name this works only while they have this toggled on until you restart or reset state

## Load PlayerBar Module

> Adds a Custom Bar Across the very top of the game screen with Players Names that are in session with Information via: Tags & Colours
> 
> > There are 2 versions now, normal game ui rendering version or V2 Playerbar which is scriptdraw and will render on top of any game component pause menu and even loading screens.
> > 
> > Version 2 Playerbar the bar can be colour designed by yourself using the feature options and have it fade from corner to corner with a different colour. I Recommend having some transparency to it (alpha) as like i explained above it draws on top of everything so it can cover parts of social club overlay (Home Key Drop Down) see image below

![PlayerBar V2](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e003353feb853decafd34548fe6c7f92dffc2a33f2b51b10602dc439ae0da677/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f313130393532353733373131323837303935342f313132353636323639353833323638323537362f696d6167652e706e67)

# MoistScript NG Translating The Script

<hr>


## Translating MoistScript NG To Another Language

As of 3.0.2.8 the translation feature has been completely re-written.

## Create translation files

in Moistscript Settings you will find a section called Moistscript Translation options enter this section and click create translation files.  
**`(Screenshot at bottom of this page)`**

Should translation files already exist they will be loaded and an updated file created with any added features since your file was created.

Translation Files are located in the MoistFiles folder within the scripts folder:

-   **TranslationFeatures.ini**
-   **TranslationHints.ini**

`Features Example`

```
GetInfo=Get Info
countryCode=Country Code: 
SaveCoords=Save Players Current POS to file
FuelLeak=Players Vehicle Leaks Fuel
```

`Hint Example`

```
LockedOnTroll=Triggers Vehicle being locked onto audio alert for that player
Lester_Khanjli=Send 2x Lesters in a Khanjali Tank to grief them
Has_Spawned_Net=Shows if you Received the Ped Spawned Network Event from this Player
```

### When Editing the file:

___

> **1 Line = 1 Feature / 1 Hint**

___

> Break the line up as Below:

___

**`Part A` = `Part B`**

___

## What to Edit?

`Part B`

> This part as indicated above which is the text to the right of the equals **`=`** sign is the part to edit change this text to your translation.

## `Part A` This Text Must not Be Changed!

## This is the variable used within the script which tells the translation feature what its going to translate! Changing it would Break your Translation!

> Checks have been put in place to avoid trying to change stuff that dont exist to prevent crashing yourself so anything with Part A that is not Exactly the same as written in the script code will be completely ignored.

___

## What to do when My Translation File is Finished?

-   **Ensure it is saved and in the MoistFiles directory within your scripts folder!**
-   **Open the script settings and enter the script translation options section**
-   **Simply click load translation to update the script with the translation** (Screenshot Below)
