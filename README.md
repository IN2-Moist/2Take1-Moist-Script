** Script Changes Additions and Fixes **

~ Major bug fix with recent players reaching reset value breaking script.
limitation has now been removed

^ Updated Attach Options:
all but the room attaches are now select-able attach to players ped or Players vehicle (if no attach entity nothing will happen to avoid any breaks when no vehicle exists or detectable)

+ Added Attach Options:

+ Added Attach FIB Building
(note that this will trigger 2t1's modder detection when attaching to peds! False invalid world object and invalid attach attempts or crash attempts on whoever is close when you are near it or spectating)

+ Added Attach Dooms Day Sub
Similar situation with the FIB Attach and false modder detection's

+ Added 2 New Script Event Crashes to Online Player Features

- Hidden empty vehicle tools in Online Player Features

Removed the delays in the Player list loop
Player bar updates faster now

Added Save-able option for the Orbital Proximity Blip.

Updated the Spawn Vehicle Triplets
Now sorted into Alpha Sub Functions
Vehicle Hash LUA updated for this will break the script if you dont update this file too.

Added Back Ceo Money 10k + 20k loop options (timing needs to be worked out still to stop transaction errors 10k alone will be fine)

** Bug Fixes **
Bugs breaking script in theory should be fixed.
updated the bounty tagging to now remove when the bounty has been taken by someone
also when bounty set on you or someone else by someone the tag now correctly gets applied to you or the person its being set on rather than the player placing the bounty.
