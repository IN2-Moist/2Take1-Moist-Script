# 2Take1-Moist-Script (Build 2.0.2.3: Moist Edition)
    Change Log:
    DELETE YOUR SAVED SETTINGS IF YOU DO NOT WANT ERRORS!
    Experiment Abandoned!
    Revert back to the old Player list Loop since some functions would not work without it

    Player Bar improved further
    More checks added so if player is Complete Retarded cunt & going around invisible we now check their speed if they are moving faster than you can run in an interior
    God Tags get applied

    God mode check & notify has been added default off at the moment will add save at a later date

    Added Other Scripts Parent with a list of all scripts in your script folder click to run they will get hidden so you cant load them more than once
    each loaded script is saved in a table so you can use the option at the top of the list (Save loaded scripts) to save them to file and allow them to autoload on start

    Options that are savable can now be done anytime, Hotkey to save Added Hold **`LCTRL+LSHIFT+S`** to save settings

    player names will still change color with their current state tags will only be added to the end of their names if they fail the checks

    [G] = God Mode Player [V] = Vehicle God [O] = Off The Radar (OTR) [G]+[V] = [G] & [V] are both on
    [UO] = Undead OTR basically player has modified their max health like you can in this script to become UnDead and not visible on the radar


 Credits & Thanks to Kektram for help with OTR Code and code Advice

Thanks to haekkzer for his help and advice over time i was a tester for the menu

Big thanks goes Proddy for all his coding help advice and work to get shit done which without him alot of this
script would  not exist! **


### GTAV Script for 2Take1s Lua Engine (by -IN2-Moist-)

## Installation

**Required Files & Folders**:

These must be inside the Folder : **scripts**

- MoistScript.lua (Main Script)

Inside the Scripts Folder you need another Folder called : **MoistsLUA_cfg**

```
- Moist_Kicks.data
- Moist_Kicks2.data
- Moist_kicks3.data
```

**Extras :**

- autoexec.lua

(Script loader this will  Auto load multiple LUA files on start)

- settings.lua

 **This is a Dependent file for Script loader (autoexec.lua) to function** 

`
also in Folder: **MoistsLUA_cfg**
`
- MoistsScript_settings.ini

(This is Default LUA Save to include Main Script when starting)
`

For Better Compatibility with **2take1script**:

```
1. Remove autoexec.lua & settings.lua
2. execute MoistScript.lua first then 2take1script
```

Seems to work so far without errors

The files and folders required are as they should be and should be extracted from the archive as above.
